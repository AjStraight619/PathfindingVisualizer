# PathfindingVisualizer
This project is a visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms, allowing users to understand the mechanics and efficiencies of different algorithms visually. Built with TypeScript and React, the project offers an interactive UI where users can draw walls, place weights, move the start and finish nodes, and see how different algorithms find the shortest path.

Features
Support for multiple pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, etc.
Dynamic grid where walls and weights can be added or removed.
Drag-and-drop feature for moving the start and finish nodes.
Algorithm comparison mode for comparing efficiencies.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd pathfinding-visualizer
Install dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
How to Use
Drawing Walls: Click and drag your mouse across the grid.
Adding Weights: Toggle the weight mode and click on the grid.
Moving Start/End Node: Drag and drop the start/end node to a new location.
Running Algorithms: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown and click on "Visualize".
